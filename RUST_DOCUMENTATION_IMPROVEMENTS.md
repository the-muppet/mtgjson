## Next Steps

While these working components now have comprehensive documentation, the critical blocking issues identified in the analysis still need to be addressed by the development team:

1. **MtgjsonLegalities**: Field type compatibility issues
2. **MtgjsonSealedProduct**: Missing initialization and wrong contents type  
3. **Set Builder**: Missing core functionality (API integration, card building)
4. **Output Generator**: Incompatible method signatures
5. **Price Builder**: Constructor and return type incompatibilities

The enhanced documentation for working components provides a solid foundation and pattern for documenting the remaining components once their functionality is implemented.
